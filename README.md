# RBY_fastrun_simulator
(This project exists mainly to be coding practice) 

RBY_fastrun_simulator aims to simulate single-Pokemon-challenge-playthroughs of Red, Blue or Yellow to find how well each species can possibly perform.
It will include tools to elimininate human error (i. E. collecting unnessesary items) and keep track of how much help a Pokemon needs (i.E learned TMs)
